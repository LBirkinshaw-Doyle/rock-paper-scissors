1. Create function called computerPlay that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’
2. Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - 
   and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
3. Make your function’s playerSelection parameter case-insensitive (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation).
4. Write a NEW function called game(). Use the previous function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.
    Use prompt() to get input from the user. Read the docs here if you need to.

ALGORITHM

function computerPlay
    create number variable randomChoice
    assign randomChoice a random number between 0 & 1
    if randomChoice <= 0.33
        return 'rock'
    else if randomChoice <= 0.66
        return 'paper'
    else
        return 'scissors'

function playerSelection
    create string variable playerChoice
    create boolean variable keepGoing = True
    while keepGoing is true
        ask the player what choice they make "Please choose from: Rock, paper, or scissors"
        assign playerChoice a string entered by the user
        make playerChoice lowercase
        if playerChoice is not  'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors'
            display an error message
        else
            assign keepGoing False
    end
    return playerChoice

function determineWinner
    create a string variable called message
    create a number variable called score
    create a switch statement on playerSelection()
        in the case that playerSelection = 'rock'
            if computerPlay is 'rock'
                assign message: 'It's a draw! Try again!'
                assign score: 0
                return the message and score
            else if computerPlay is 'paper'
                assign message: 'You lose! Their paper beats your rock!'
                assign score: -1
                return the message and score
            else
                assign message: 'You win! Your rock beats their scissors!'
                assign score: 1
                return the message and score
        in the case that playerSelection = 'paper'
            if computerPlay is 'rock'
                assign message: 'You win! Your paper beats their rock!'
                assign score: 1
                return the message and score
            else if computerPlay is 'paper'
                assign message: 'It's a draw! Try again!'
                assign score: 0
                return the message and score
            else
                assign message: 'You lose! Their scissors beats your paper!'
                assign score: -1
                return the message and score
        in the case that playerSelection = 'scissors'
            if computerPlay is 'rock'
                assign message: 'You lose! Their rock beats your scissors!'
                assign score: -1
                return the message and score
            else if computerPlay is 'paper'
                assign message: 'You win! Your scissors beats their paper!'
                assign score: 1
                return the message and score
            else
                assign message: 'It's a draw! Try again!'
                assign score: 0
                return the message and score
