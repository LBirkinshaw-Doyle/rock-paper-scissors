1. Create function called computerPlay that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’
2. Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - 
   and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
3. Make your function’s playerSelection parameter case-insensitive (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation).
4. Write a NEW function called game(). Use the previous function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.

ALGORITHM

run the function playGame()

function computerSelection
    create number variable randomChoice
    assign randomChoice a random number between 0 & 1
    if randomChoice <= 0.33
        return 'rock'
    else if randomChoice <= 0.66
        return 'paper'
    else
        return 'scissors'

function playerSelection
    create string variable playerChoice
    create boolean variable keepGoing = True
    while keepGoing is true
        ask the player what choice they make "Please choose from: Rock, paper, or scissors"
        assign playerChoice a string entered by the user
        make playerChoice lowercase
        if playerChoice is not  'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors'
            display an error message
        else
            assign keepGoing False
    end
    return playerChoice

function determineWinner(player, computer)
    create a string variable called message
    create a number variable called score
    create a switch statement on input variable player
        in the case that player = 'rock'
            if computer is 'rock'
                assign message: 'It's a draw! Try again!'
                assign score: 0
                return the message and score
            else if computer is 'paper'
                assign message: 'You lose this round! Their paper beats your rock!'
                assign score: -1
                return the message and score
            else
                assign message: 'You win this round! Your rock beats their scissors!'
                assign score: 1
                return the message and score
        in the case that player = 'paper'
            if computer is 'rock'
                assign message: 'You win this round! Your paper beats their rock!'
                assign score: 1
                return the message and score

                assign score: 0
                return the message and score
            else

                assign score: -1
                return the message and score
        in the case that player = 'scissors'
            if computer is 'rock'
                assign message: 'You lose this round! Their rock beats your scissors!'
                assign score: -1
                return the message and score
            else if computer is 'paper'
                assign message: 'You win this round! Your scissors beats their paper!'
                assign score: 1
                return the message and score
            else
                assign message: 'It's a draw! Try again!'
                assign score: 0
                return the message and score

function playRound()
    create string variable player
    create string variable computer
    create string variable message
    create string variable score

    assign player the output of playerSelection()
    assign computer the output of computerSelection()

    assign message and score the output of determineWinner(player, computer)

    display the message
    return the score

function playGame()
    create int variable roundNumber with value 1
    create number variable score
    create array variable scoreCard
    create number variable overallWinner

    display message: "Game on! Best of five, draws don't count!"

    while roundNumber <= 5
        assign score the output of playRound()
        if score is not 0
            increment roundNumber 1
            assign score to scoreCard (append?)
    end

    assign overallWinner the summation of scoreCard
    if overallWinner is > 0
        display the message: "You won! Congratulations!"
    else
        display the message: "You lost! Better luck next time!"
